Hi, I’m @tonystyang
I'm an Operations Research Analyst for the U.S. Army and graduated from Emory in 2020 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 
I hope to learn more about statistical models, machine learning techniques, and how to apply them to real world data. 
Open to new career opportunities.
